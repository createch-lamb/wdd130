            <p>If you love the outdoors, Utah is the place to be. It is located in the west of the United States of America. People have named Utah as having "The Greatest Snow On Earth." In the winter, you can ski and snowboard and in the rest of the seasons you can hike at the majestic mountains that surrounds you. There is a hike for anyone! There are plenty of places to boat and kayak. In Utah, we love our family. Any time is family time. States that are close by are Colorado, Arizona, Las Vegas, Idaho and Wyoming.</p>
